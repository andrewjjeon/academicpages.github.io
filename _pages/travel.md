Seattle

  Seattle (and surrounding area) is a gorgeous, melancholic, and productive city. There are so many amazing hikes, lakes, snowsports, watersports, outdoor activities etc within a 1-2 hour radius of Seattle. The cityscape at night is also beautiful. The summers are short, the rest of the year is gray with a constant drizzle. Seattle is a highly productive city, most obviously in tech with titans Microsoft and Amazon being headquartered in it. There is also strong presence in Science and research through the University of Washington and related research institutes. This attracts many engineers, scientists, and career-focused individuals. This abundance of career-focused individuals combined with the Seattle Freeze could be why the city punches above its weight economically, but reports [high levels of depression](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/data/seattle-still-the-nations-saddest-large-metro-area-survey-shows/).

Portland (and surrounding area) is a funky, sporty, and beautiful city. With Mount Hood towering above the city from many angles, you often get beautiful pink sky sunsets with Mount Hood fading away into the night sky. This area also is right next to the Columbia River Gorge which is breathtaking. Cannon Beach and countless other misty, pretty Pacific Northwest beaches are also 1-2 hour drives away. There is whale watching, sea lion caves, coastal towns, waterfalls, hikes, snowsports, sand dunes, and more all within a 1-2 hour radius of Portland. Portland attracts many artists, musicians, and other creatives. It also attracts many athletes and sportswear professionals as Nike is headquartered there along with its many competitors.
