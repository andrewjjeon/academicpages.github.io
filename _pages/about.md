Hello! I'm Andrew, a Masters student at the University of Washington studying Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Robotics. I'm interested in using Representation Learning and Computer Vision (multimodal and low-dimensional representations) to enable 3D reconstruction and understanding for Robotics and Autonomous Systems.

Other Interests that I havenâ€™t worked on but want to in the future
- Multi-agent systems (multi-agent robotic systems that explore, cooperate, etc.)
- AI for strategic games and situations (AlphaStar, CICERO, LLMs Play StarCraft II, etc.)

Background
======
I received my Bachelor of Science from [UIUC ECE](https://ece.illinois.edu/). After my undergraduate education, I worked in the automation, and semiconductor industries for a couple years before returning to graduate school to study and research machine learning and robotics.
